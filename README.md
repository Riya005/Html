I had the opportunity to lead the development of a dynamic and user-friendly website for a prominent Food Delivery Company. 
The objective was to create an online platform that enhances the customer's experience while streamlining the ordering and delivery processes.

Responsive Design: I designed the website using HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices. This responsive design significantly improved the user experience, making it accessible to a broader audience.
